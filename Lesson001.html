    p – Paragraph. You'll put a paragraph of text together inside of a p tag. Only text goes in p tags. Each one of these paragraphs is a p tag. Example: <p>A paragraph of text</p>.

    a – Anchor. An a tag is a link to somewhere else. This is a link that goes nowhere. Every a tag needs a destination of where the link should take you. We'll talk about that in the Attributes section. Example: <a href="https://www.frontendmasters.com">Frontend Masters</a>.

div – Short for division. A div is sort of like a cardboard box. It's not really anything by itself; it's more defined by what's in it. It's a generic container tag for grouping together other things. You'll use a lot of divs. Very useful with CSS. In general, you want to group together "like" things into a containing tag (like a div) to keep them together. If you have a website with a list of blog posts that each have paragraphs, titles, images, etc. you'll group each post together in a div or other container-type tag typically.

<div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: red;"></div>

<div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: blue;"></div>

span – A container for small pieces of text. If a div is like a cardboard box, a span is like a Ziploc bag. It doesn't change the styling of anything by itself but it allows you use CSS and JavaScript later to make that text different in some way. Example: <p>Here is some text. <span>This text is in a span</span> but it doesn't look any different.</p>

-->

<p>Here is some text. <span>This text is in a span</span> but it doesn't look any different.</p>

<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline">important</span> text</p>

ol, ul, and li – Both ol and ul represent lists. In fact, this list of various tags is a ul! A ul is an unordered list: it's a list of things that could be shuffled and still mean the same thing. If I asked you to list all the teams in a sports league, or all the characters on a TV show, those could be presented in any order. An ol is an ordered list: what comes first matters. If I ask you to list out the ten most populous cities in the world, there is an order to that and changing the order makes the list incorrect. In either list, each item in the list is an li. Example: <ul><li>Bob</li><li>Eve</li><li>Alice</li></ul>

-->

<ol>
    <li>The First One</li>
    <li>The Second One</li>
    <li>The Third One</li>
  </ol>
  
  <ul>
    <li>An Item in the List</li>
    <li>Another Item in the List</li>
    <li>A Yet Different Item in the List</li>
  </ul>

  button – A … button. A button can be used by JavaScript to respond to a user clicking it, or it can be used by a form to signal a user has completed filling it and it should submit the data. Think of it like a doorbell to your house: you can put the doorbell button there but it's not going to do much unless you connect it to the buzzer. Example: <button>Click me!!</button>

  -->

  <button>Click me!!</button>

  <button>Click me! I don't do anything</button>
