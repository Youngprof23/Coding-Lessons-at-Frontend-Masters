   Tags
HTML's base building block is the tag. A tag is a building block. It describes what's inside it. Every tag has an opening and a closing tag (some tags open and close at the same point.) I think the easiest way to learn it is just to show a bunch of examples. 

Types of Tags
So let's explore some of the essential tag types.

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 â€“ Headings. These are the six levels of headings and subheadings you can have. You can see up top of this page we have HTML which is an h1 and then below that we have Types of Tags which is an h2. An h2 is a subheading to an h1. An h3 is a subheading to a h2. Some schools of thought say each page should only have one h1.
